# Different Answers from Differnt Implementation

## How I Found the Tests With different Reuslts

To find the different tests with different results took me several steps.
First I ran the bash script for my implementation of the markdown parse
and the professor's version of the markdown parse. I stored each of the bash 
script output in a text file called results.txt. Then I used diff to compare
the results of the two results.txt file. I stored  the results of the diff
commmand in a file called compareResults.txt and it showed me all the
tests where there were differnt results.
